The goal of this script is to simply pass the port # as an argument when running the script, and scan the entire subnet for open instances of that port.
Using Nmap, it will reveal all systems on the subnet with the specified port open. At the end, the script will give the user an option whether to continue to
a deeper scan that provides more specific data such as versions. 


This is a very quick and reliable script to discover commonly targeted/vulnerable ports in your network at a point in time.
Also, this can be a great starting point to take the data that is presented and perform other actions.
